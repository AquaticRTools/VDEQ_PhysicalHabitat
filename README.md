# VDEQ_PhysicalHabitat
This repository holds scripts to run the VDEQ physical habitat analysis. See http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/Water/WaterQualityMonitoring/ProbabilisticMonitoring/Products/Phab.zip for associated Access database.  VDEQ is limited to 32bit version of MS Access, so you need to run the scripts in 32 bit version of R.
